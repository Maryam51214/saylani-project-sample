          A privacy policy (also referred to as a privacy notice) is a statement or legal document that describes how a company, website, or app collects, uses, maintains, and shares information collected from or about its users. Most countries require any website that collects personal information from its users to have a written privacy policy posted on the website.</p>
          <p>A website’s privacy policy outlines if and how you collect, use, share, or sell your visitors’ personal information and is required under data privacy laws.

Using a privacy policy template helps jump-start the process of making one of these essential legal documents for your site.</p>
